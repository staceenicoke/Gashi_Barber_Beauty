About Creation:			Hausa is that largest west African ethnic group.
				In researching salon/barber related terms in other languages
				I found Hausa language to be the most intriguing and unique
				Not all words translate and I had to dig deeper for
				the Hausa term.

				Names of the Stylists & Barbers are my children
				My son has a "Bear" is the youngest
				My son "Aries Max" is actually Aries Max-Wayne; he has
					a love of art and extremely talented.  His barber
					also has a love for art so he always has designs
					and pictured cut in the side of his hair
				My daughter Talaya has watched me throughout her 13 years
					and wants to be a Cosmetologist.  I asked her what
					she would call her salon; she said "Hair with Talaya"
				Son Dangi "Love Family" was my first choice over Gashi
				LoveStaceeNicole and ILoveStaceeNicole are the handles I use
					for my work and connections so I tried to incorporate it
					Instead I added "Love" to parts of packages.
